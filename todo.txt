TODO (first - most important):
- user reviews for spots (adding reviews)
- fix measuring distance from user to spots (it's too low)
- user reviews for spots (home page)
- check bottom navigation bar on phone with bottom notch (like newer iPhones), consider using SafeArea
- animate map when zooming
- geolocalization when adding a new spot ("use my location" feature)
- BIG code refactoring (cubit state classes, formatting, naming conventions etc.)
- fix emitting validation errors - error notifiers in text fields or something
- bloc and widget tests for the process of adding a new spot
