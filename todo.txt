TODO (first - most important):
- U user reviews for spots (home page)
- U check bottom navigation bar on phone with bottom notch (like newer iPhones), consider using SafeArea
- U geolocalization when adding a new spot ("use my location" feature)
- C classes with `Model` suffix - are they needed?
- C BIG code refactoring (cubit state classes, formatting, naming conventions etc.)
- C fix emitting validation errors - error notifiers in text fields or something
- C bloc and widget tests for the process of adding a new spot


U: user-facing
C: code-related
