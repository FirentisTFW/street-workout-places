- bloc and widget tests for the process of adding a new spot
- home page
- filtering spots
- check bottom navigation bar on phone with bottom notch (like newer iPhones), consider using SafeArea
- migrate from freezed to equatable
- geolocalization (filters, adding new spot etc.)

IMPORTANT:
- filter by query
- go to filters page
- select any filter and confirm
Q: What spots should be shown? Only the ones matching the query and filters?
Or should we then discard the query and filter only by filters, taking from all available spots?
