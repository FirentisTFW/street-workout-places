TODO (first - most important):
- user reviews for spots
- check bottom navigation bar on phone with bottom notch (like newer iPhones), consider using SafeArea
- geolocalization when adding a new spot ("use my location" feature)
- BIG code refactoring (cubit state classes, formatting, naming conventions etc.)
- bloc and widget tests for the process of adding a new spot
