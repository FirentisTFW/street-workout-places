Potential improvements:

- spots_page.dart:
    - consider encapsulating controller and notifier in separate class in order to move tab changing logic away from the page
- spot_details_page.dart
    - consider texts "Opis:" and "Sprzęt:" above apropriate widgets
- spot_map.dart
    - group markers nearby and show one icon for them with the number of spots written
